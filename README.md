SILVA -- VoiceBot

Silva Makes your life better!



This is a VoiceBot created for supporting elderly people on phones with technical issues.



We believe that using VoiceBot will be much easier for the elderly to communicate and get problems solved. Since many old people cannot see very well on screen (chatbot), from our own experiences of interacting with our grandparents, we think that Phone Calls are a much easier way to communicate with the elderly. Besides, the elderly overlap with other vulnerable people due to their aging bodies, so we believe there is a need for some innovative way to tackle the problem. Being the younger generation in the family, we were always asked by our seniors to help them with solving technical problems on their phones or computers. Hence, the vulnerable group was chosen as the elderly to bridge the digital divide and help reduce the gap for the elderly.

When we were doing some background research, we found that there are existing chatbots and a voice bot for healthcare, yet, there isn't one specifically for technical support. Understanding that many elderly have the problem of tech anxiety, our team decided to make a VoiceBot specifically for supporting the elderly with their technical problems.





To test it, 

1. Wait until the developers of Silva run "node backend.js" to set up the server.

2. Once the server is up, simply dial +44 7403 939825 on your phone.

3. Silva should be here to help you now! :D



Note: Don't worry if you accidentally hang up the call, Silva remembers and will keep helping you once you've reconnected by calling again! 





Technologies used in setting up SILVA:

- Twilio: for the call and the voice recognition 

- ChatGPT: for generating the replies

- Google Neural2-A: for generating a natural AI human voice
